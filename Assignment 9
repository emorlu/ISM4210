Assignment 9 
Chapter 09, Murach's 2012 SQL Server
Using SQL Functions: String, Numeric, Date/Time, ISNULL, IIF, CASE, CHOOSE


Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Products table: 
The ListPrice column 
The DiscountPercent column 
A column named DiscountAmount that uses the previous two columns to calculate the discount amount and uses the ROUND 
function to round the result to 2 decimal places

SELECT ListPrice, DiscountPercent, ROUNT(((DiscountPercent/100) * ListPrice),2) AS DiscountAmount
FROM Products;

2. Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table: 
The OrderDate column 
A column that returns the four-digit year that’s stored in the OrderDate column 
A column that returns only the day of the month that’s stored in the OrderDate column. 
A column that returns the result from adding thirty days to the OrderDate column. 

SELECT OrderDate, YEAR(OrderDate) as OrderYear, 
DAY(OrderDate) as OrderDay, DATEADD(Day, 30, OrderDate) as DateDue
FROM Orders;

3. Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table: 
The CardNumber column 
The length of the CardNumber column 
The last four digits of the CardNumber column 
When you get that working right, add the column that follows to the result set. This is more difficult because the column 
requires the use of functions within functions. 
A column that displays the last four digits of the CardNumber column in this format: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234. In 
other words, use Xs for the first 12 digits of the card number and actual numbers for the last four digits of the 
number. 

SELECT CardNumber, LEN(CardNumber) as LengthCount, RIGHT(CardNumber, 4) as LastFourDigits, 
'XXXX-XXXX-XXXX'+ RIGHT(CardNumber, 4) as FormattedNumber
FROM Orders;

4. Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Orders table: 
The OrderID column 
The OrderDate column 
A column named ApproxShipDate that’s calculated by adding 2 days to the OrderDate column 
The ShipDate column 
A column named DaysToShip that shows the number of days between the order date and the ship date 
When you have this working, add a WHERE clause that retrieves just the orders for March 2012. 

SELECT(OrderID, OrderDate, DATEADD(day, 2, OrderDate) AS 'ApproxShipDate', ShipDate,
DATEAIFF(Day, OrderDate, ShipDate) AS DaysToShip
FROM ORDERS 
WHERE 
MONTH(ORDERDATE) = 03
AND 
YEAR(ORDERDATE = 2012;
